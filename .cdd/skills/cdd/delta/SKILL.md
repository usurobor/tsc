# δ (delta) — the cell's boundary actor

## Core Principle

**δ is the coherence cell's boundary — the actor that decides what crosses from scope `n` to scope `n+1`, and the actor that enriches what crosses from γ's protocol-level contract into α's executable dispatch.**

δ is a **two-sided membrane**:

```text
δ as two-sided membrane:

  outward:  receipt + V verdict → parent-scope boundary decision   (§1)
            (V dereferences evidence from the receipt; δ records
             a BoundaryDecision against the verdict)

  inward:   γ contract → α-ready dispatch                           (§2)
            (implementation-contract enrichment happens here:
             γ writes protocol-level; δ pins implementation-level)
```

`COHERENCE-CELL-NORMAL-FORM.md` (CCNF) names δ at step 5 of the kernel — δ reads the receipt and V's verdict and records a `BoundaryDecision`. `RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md` freezes the typed interface: V emits a `ValidationVerdict`; δ emits a `BoundaryDecision`; the two surfaces are independent and compose by an explicit rule (§4 below). The δ-inward function is the complementary face — the dispatch-time enrichment that pins the implementation-contract axes γ's protocol-level contract leaves unpinned.

**δ-the-role lives here.** δ-as-actor in a running CDD cycle (γ=δ collapse cases, dispatch coordination, gate routing) lives in [`operator/SKILL.md`](../operator/SKILL.md); the harness substrate (dispatch invocation, observability, identity, polling, timeout recovery) lives in [`harness/SKILL.md`](../harness/SKILL.md) (Phase 4b of cnos#366, landed at cnos#398); release-effector mechanics live in [`release-effector/SKILL.md`](../release-effector/SKILL.md) (Phase 4c of cnos#366, landed at cnos#399). The four surfaces are deliberately separate: the role-skill is portable (any role-scope ladder instantiation per `ROLES.md` can carry it); the substrate skills are the substrate-specific realizations on the current substrate (per CCNF §Two-Layer Separation: kernel is the *what*, realization is the *how-on-this-substrate*).

> **First-time operator?** The dispatch-coordination layer (γ=δ collapse, single-session vs multi-session, harness quiescence, timeout recovery) is in [`operator/SKILL.md`](../operator/SKILL.md) (coordination) + [`harness/SKILL.md`](../harness/SKILL.md) (mechanics). δ-the-role's authority and policy live here.

---

## 1. Outward membrane — receipt + verdict → boundary decision

The outward face of δ runs after γ closes the cell and emits the receipt. V validates the receipt against the contract (per CCNF step 4 + `RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md` §Q1) and emits a `ValidationVerdict`. δ then records a `BoundaryDecision` — the outward act that determines whether and how the closed cell crosses to scope `n+1`.

```text
γ closes cell                    →   closed_cell exists; receipt drafted
γ emits receipt                  →   receipt exists; cell is "closed", not "accepted"
δ invokes V on receipt           →   V emits ValidationVerdict
δ records BoundaryDecision       →   {accept | release | override | reject | repair_dispatch}
ACCEPTED                         →   receipt transmissible to parent scope
```

(Per `RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md` §Q1 ordering rule. `V` is a typed predicate exposed as a capability per §Q2; δ invokes the capability, not the operator-facing `cn-cdd-verify` command.)

### 1.1. External actions δ-the-role authorises

δ-as-role holds **authority** for the platform actions that cross the boundary. The mechanics of executing these actions live in three companion surfaces: [`operator/SKILL.md`](../operator/SKILL.md) §3 (gate-action confirmation protocol, request-vs-observation discipline); [`harness/SKILL.md`](../harness/SKILL.md) (dispatch invocation, observability, identity, polling, timeout recovery — landed via Phase 4b of cnos#366, cycle/398); [`release-effector/SKILL.md`](../release-effector/SKILL.md) (`scripts/release.sh` invocation, post-push CI polling, recovery runbook, branch deletes — landed via Phase 4c of cnos#366, cycle/399). The authority-naming surface lives here:

| Action | Authority | Mechanics location |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Pre-merge gate validation | δ authorises; γ requests via `scripts/validate-release-gate.sh --mode pre-merge` (`cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` §"Artifact contract" → §"Ownership matrix" + `gamma/SKILL.md` §2.10) | `operator/SKILL.md` §3.1 |
| Push β-approved merge to main | δ executes on β's behalf when env/auth blocks β; this is execution of β's integration authority, not δ approval | `operator/SKILL.md` §3.1 |
| Release-boundary preflight | δ verifies merge commit, release artifacts, tag/deploy preconditions, platform readiness; decision is proceed / request changes / override (`cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` §"Development lifecycle" → §"Step table" Step 9 — δ gate) | `operator/SKILL.md` §3.1 |
| Tag push + release | **δ is sole tag-author** — β does not tag; only δ creates tags per cycle | `release-effector/SKILL.md` |
| Branch delete | After cycle closure and merge | `release-effector/SKILL.md` §5 |
| Issue filing on external repos | Cross-project dependency | `operator/SKILL.md` §3.1 |
| Force push | Rebase required with env constraints | `operator/SKILL.md` §3.1 |
| Auth refresh | Token/permission expiry | `operator/SKILL.md` §3.1 |

The role-policy that governs the release boundary: **the triad's work is not complete until tagged.** Untagged post-cycle patches on main are an open boundary — the triad's output is still entangled with whatever comes next. The tag is the disconnection point. δ-as-role commits to this property; the `scripts/release.sh` runbook lives in [`release-effector/SKILL.md`](../release-effector/SKILL.md) (Phase 4c of cnos#366 — landed via cycle/399; the doctrinal frame stays at `operator/SKILL.md` §3.4).

**δ blocks release completion until CI is green and owns recovery on red.** This is δ-role policy:

- **CI Green** → δ declares release complete.
- **CI Red** → δ owns the failure. Investigate release logs; classify as release-specific vs pre-existing infrastructure; fix or escalate; re-verify; operator override (§3 below) is the explicit escape hatch for known pre-existing failures (cf. v3.66.0/v3.67.0 smoke failures).

The gate does not close until CI is green or δ explicitly records an override (§3).

### 1.2. Execute on request, not on observation

Gate actions fire when a role **requests** them, not when δ notices they're needed. Observing that a tag isn't pushed or a branch exists is not a gate trigger — γ's explicit request is.

- ❌ Heartbeat shows tag not pushed → δ pushes it (role leak: δ decided the gate, not γ)
- ❌ "β asked me to push the merge but I think we should wait for one more review"
- ✅ γ requests tag push → δ pushes it and confirms
- ✅ If you disagree with a gate request, declare an override (§3)

### 1.3. Report completion

After executing a gate action, confirm to the requesting role that the action completed.

- ❌ Execute silently and assume the triad will notice
- ✅ "Tag pushed: `git push origin 3.59.0` — confirmed on remote"

### 1.4. The tag is the signal

The disconnect tag (cf. `operator/SKILL.md` §3.4 for the runbook) is git-observable. γ and all future agents can see it. No separate completion signal is needed — the tag appearing on main IS the proof that all gate actions completed and the cycle is disconnected.

For mid-cycle gate actions (tag push before the disconnect, branch cleanup), confirm completion to the requesting role per §1.3. But the disconnect tag itself needs no announcement — it speaks for itself.

### 1.5. BoundaryDecision: the five outcomes δ records

Per CCNF §Cell Outcomes, the closed cell at scope `n` terminates in one of four outcomes, determined by `(verdictₙ, decisionₙ)`. δ records `decisionₙ` as one of five enumerants; the outcome is the `(verdict, decision)` pair:

| `decisionₙ` (δ records) | When | CCNF outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `accept` | `verdictₙ = PASS` and the cell is transmissible to scope `n+1` without release-boundary semantics | `accepted` |
| `release` | `verdictₙ = PASS` and the cell ships as a release boundary (tag + downstream-distributable disconnection) | `accepted` |
| `override` | `verdictₙ ≠ PASS` and δ proceeds anyway by recording a structured override block (§3 below) | `degraded` |
| `reject` | δ refuses transmission for boundary-policy reasons; the cell terminates at scope `n` with no projection | `blocked` |
| `repair_dispatch` | The cell stays open at scope `n`; a child cell at scope `n` runs under a repair contract; on child accept γₙ re-emits a fresh `receiptₙ` and steps 4–5 re-fire (CCNF §Recursion Modes) | `blocked` (within-scope) |

The `(PASS, override)` and `(non-PASS, accept/release)` pairs are **invalid** per CCNF §Cell Outcomes — these are non-terminal states; δ re-decides until the outcome is one of `{accepted, degraded, blocked}`.

---

## 2. Inward membrane — γ contract → α-ready dispatch (implementation-contract enrichment)

The inward face of δ runs at dispatch time, before α is routed. γ writes the protocol-level contract (gap, ACs, oracle, evidence). γ also writes the 7-axis `## Implementation contract` section into the α prompt. **δ reviews that section before routing**, fills any unpopulated row per repo conventions (logging the enrichment in `.cdd/unreleased/{N}/gamma-clarification.md`), or blocks dispatch and escalates to operator-as-human when a row is genuinely undecidable. **Implementation-contract decisions belong to δ; α MUST NOT improvise.**

**Canonical doctrine lives at [`cnos.handoff/skills/handoff/dispatch/SKILL.md`](../../../../cnos.handoff/skills/handoff/dispatch/SKILL.md)** (Sub 3 of [cnos#404](https://github.com/usurobor/cnos/issues/404), shipped under [cnos#417](https://github.com/usurobor/cnos/issues/417)). That skill owns:

- the 7 architectural axes (Language; CLI integration target; Package scoping; Existing-binary disposition; Runtime dependencies; JSON/wire contract preservation; Backward-compat invariant);
- the dispatch-prompt template γ injects the contract block into;
- the δ review-before-routing duty and the fill-or-escalate paths;
- the four-surface mesh (γ template / δ enrichment / α constraint / β verification);
- the cnos#389/#391/#392/#393 empirical anchors.

δ's role-local realization here: δ is the actor that performs the inward review at routing time. The doctrine — what δ is responsible for, why δ holds this authority rather than γ alone, how the contract distributes across γ/α/β — lives at the canonical handoff path. The two-sided framing of δ (outward §1 + inward §2) remains the membrane's core; this section is the inward half, with doctrine sourced from cnos.handoff and execution executed here.

### 2.1. Phase 4a / Sub 3 landing note

The inward-membrane substance landed as Phase 4a of cnos#366 (cycle/397) in this file; **Sub 3 of cnos#404 (cycle/417) extracts the doctrine into [`cnos.handoff/skills/handoff/dispatch/SKILL.md`](../../../../cnos.handoff/skills/handoff/dispatch/SKILL.md)** alongside the dispatch-prompt template and the four-surface mesh declaration. This section is now a pointer; the role-local realization (δ-as-actor at routing time) stays here. **Phase 4b — harness substrate** landed in [`harness/SKILL.md`](../harness/SKILL.md) via cnos#398 (cycle/398). **Phase 4c — release-effector mechanics** landed in [`release-effector/SKILL.md`](../release-effector/SKILL.md) via cnos#399 (cycle/399). **Phase 5 — γ shrink** landed at cnos#400 (cycle/400). The complete two-sided framing (outward §1 + inward §2 of this file) is preserved; the doctrine for §2 is sourced from handoff.

## 3. Override — degraded boundary action

**Override is a degraded boundary action; it is never a form of validity, and it never rewrites V's verdict.** This is the load-bearing freeze from [`RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md`](../RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md) §Q4 (cnos#367) — restated here as δ-role doctrine because δ is the actor that records overrides.

### 3.1. Override does not rewrite the ValidationVerdict

An override is a structured `override:` block inside the receipt's `boundary` block, populated by δ when δ records a `BoundaryDecision` of `override` against a non-PASS `ValidationVerdict`. The `validation` block of the receipt continues to carry V's original verdict **unchanged** — override does not rewrite, mask, or replace the `ValidationVerdict`. The presence of a non-null `boundary.override` is the structural signal to every downstream consumer that the receipt closed in degraded state.

Three explicit failure modes if the design or implementation drifts:

1. **Override never rewrites the `ValidationVerdict`.** The `validation` block carries V's emitted verdict. `validation.result` stays at FAIL; `validation.failures` stays populated. δ does not edit, redact, or replace V's verdict. The verdict is what V saw; the override is what δ did with it. The two are separate fields with separate authors.
2. **Override never substitutes for PASS in downstream consumers.** A receipt where `validation.result == FAIL` and `boundary.override` is populated is **not equivalent** to a receipt where `validation.result == PASS` and `boundary.override == null`. Downstream V at scope n+1 — reading the n-receipt as evidence — must distinguish these two cases. Treating a degraded n-receipt as PASS-equivalent would let degradation propagate silently into the parent scope.
3. **Override never emits `OVERRIDE-PASS` as a `ValidationVerdict`.** V emits PASS, FAIL, and possibly WARN. There is no `OVERRIDE-PASS` value. Override lives in the `BoundaryDecision` shape (an enumerant of what δ decided), not in the `ValidationVerdict` shape (an enumerant of what V observed). Fusing them would let δ-side decisions reach back and rewrite V-side observations.

### 3.2. Downstream-consumer detection rule (binding biconditional, per cnos#367)

```text
A receipt is degraded ⇔ boundary.override != null.
A receipt is PASS-equivalent ⇔ validation.result == PASS AND boundary.override == null.

Every downstream consumer of a receipt — including:
  - the parent scope's V (V at scope n+1)
  - the parent scope's δ
  - operators auditing the cycle
  - cn-cdd-verify when reading a closed cycle
— MUST check both validation.result and boundary.override before
treating the receipt as a clean closure. Reading only one of the
two fields is incorrect.
```

The biconditional form is load-bearing. A consumer that checks only `validation.result == PASS` and assumes clean closure is incorrect (it misses degraded cells V did not approve). A consumer that checks only `boundary.override == null` and assumes clean closure is also incorrect (it misses cells where V emitted FAIL but no override exists — which is itself an incomplete-closure state per `COHERENCE-CELL.md` §Receipt Validity: "A missing override block plus a non-PASS V is not a receipt — it is an incomplete closure"). Both fields must be checked together.

### 3.3. When δ overrides

The δ-as-role may override a triad decision (or proceed past a non-PASS verdict) when:

- The triad's direction conflicts with project priorities the triad cannot see
- A role is stuck in a loop and γ's unblocking hasn't resolved it
- External constraints force a scope change (e.g. deadline, dependency shift)
- Safety or security requires immediate action
- A known pre-existing infrastructure failure (release CI red on infra unrelated to the cycle) — the explicit escape hatch named in §1.1

Override is **for information asymmetry or hard constraints, not preference**.

- ❌ "I think the implementation should use a different approach" → that's α's job
- ❌ "The review was too harsh" → that's β's judgment
- ✅ "The API we're building against is being deprecated next week" → information the triad needs

### 3.4. Override protocol

Per `cnos.cds/skills/cds/CDS.md` §"Field 6: Actor collapse rule" and `operator/SKILL.md` §3.4 (override protocol): the reassignment must name the target agent and the reason. No implicit drift.

State:

1. What you are overriding (role assignment, scope, priority, decision, or the non-PASS verdict)
2. Why (the information or constraint the triad didn't have)
3. What the new state is

When the override is against a non-PASS `ValidationVerdict`, populate the structured `override:` block in the receipt's `boundary` block with at minimum:

- `actor` — δ identity (e.g. `delta@cdd.cnos`)
- `justification` — narrative reason for the override
- `original_validation_verdict` — V's emitted verdict or a typed reference to it
- `failed_predicates_overridden` — list of the specific failed predicate refs the override covers (blanket "override all failures" is forbidden)
- `degraded_state` — `true`

Examples:

- ❌ Edit the issue quietly and let α discover the change
- ❌ Override = "PASS" silently propagated downstream
- ✅ "Override: descoping AC4–AC5 from this cycle. Reason: timeline constraint for release by Friday. New scope: AC1–AC3 only. γ to update the issue."
- ✅ "Override: release CI red on smoke test unrelated to cycle scope (known infra issue, cnos#NNN). Boundary block populated with `failed_predicates_overridden: [release_ci_smoke]`; `validation.result` remains as V emitted; downstream V at scope n+1 reads degraded matter."

### 3.5. ValidationVerdict vs BoundaryDecision — the structural distinction

The two surfaces are independent and must not be fused. Per `RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md` §"ValidationVerdict vs BoundaryDecision":

| Surface | Emitted by | Describes | Lives in receipt block |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ValidationVerdict` | V (the predicate) | Whether the receipt satisfies the contract+evidence predicates | `validation` |
| `BoundaryDecision` | δ (this role) | What δ decided to do with the receipt at the boundary | `boundary` |

The composition rule binds them but does not collapse them. Three explicit constraints follow:

1. **V does not record boundary decisions.** V emits a verdict — PASS or FAIL — and a structured failure list. V does not record "accepted" or "rejected" or "released." Those are δ's. The `validation` block of the receipt is V-owned; the `boundary` block is δ-owned.
2. **δ does not rewrite ValidationVerdict.** δ may decide to override a FAIL verdict, but δ does not rewrite the verdict to PASS. The verdict stays FAIL; the override block carries the degraded boundary action.
3. **PASS-equivalence is the conjunction.** A receipt is PASS-equivalent for downstream consumers iff `validation.verdict == PASS` AND `boundary.override == null` (§3.2). Either condition failing makes the receipt non-PASS-equivalent.

For the embedded kata exercising override (Kata B — "α stuck on AC3 due to undocumented API change"), see [`operator/SKILL.md`](../operator/SKILL.md) §9.

---

## 4. Composition with V (RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md)

Per `RECEIPT-VALIDATION.md` §Validation Interface, the composition rule:

```text
ValidationVerdict.verdict == PASS
    → δ may record BoundaryDecision in {accept, release}
    → δ may also record BoundaryDecision in {reject, repair_dispatch} if boundary-policy
      reasons orthogonal to V demand it (release freeze, downstream readiness check)

ValidationVerdict.verdict == FAIL
    → δ may record BoundaryDecision in {reject, repair_dispatch}
    → δ may record BoundaryDecision == override only as a degraded boundary action,
      with the override block populated per §3. boundary.override != null is the
      structural signal that downstream consumers MUST detect.
```

V makes acceptance **available** to δ on PASS; V does not make acceptance **automatic**. δ holds final gate authority over what crosses the boundary, and the `BoundaryDecision` is what δ records after consulting the verdict.

For the four closed-cell outcomes (`accepted`, `degraded`, `blocked`, `invalid`) and the within-scope vs cross-scope recursion modes, see [`COHERENCE-CELL-NORMAL-FORM.md`](../COHERENCE-CELL-NORMAL-FORM.md) §Cell Outcomes and §Recursion Modes.

---

## 5. What δ-as-role does NOT do

These are role boundaries at the role-skill level (CCNF kernel surface). For the dispatch-coordinator role boundaries (δ-as-actor's coordinator hat in γ=δ collapse cases), see [`operator/SKILL.md`](../operator/SKILL.md) §6.

- **δ does not produce matter.** That's α's signature (CCNF step 1). If δ wants to fix something, δ declares an override and takes the α role explicitly under the override discipline (§3).
- **δ does not discriminate matter.** That's β's signature (CCNF step 2). If δ disagrees with β's review, δ may override the boundary decision; δ does not rewrite β's review.
- **δ does not close cells.** That's γ's signature (CCNF step 3). δ does not author or edit the receipt; γ binds evidence and emits. δ reads the receipt and acts at the boundary.
- **δ does not re-read the evidence graph.** δ's signature in CCNF (step 5) explicitly excludes evidence as input. δ trusts V's verdict. If δ doubts the verdict, δ has two paths: invoke V again (reproducible from the same inputs), or `repair_dispatch` the cell to recompute its matter.
- **δ does not pronounce non-PASS receipts valid.** Override is degraded; override is not validity (§3.1).

## 7. Phase 4 of cnos#366 — what this cycle ships and what remains

This file (`delta/SKILL.md`) is Phase 4a of cnos#366. It carries:

- The two-sided membrane doctrine (outward §1, inward §2)
- Override semantics (§3) with the verdict-vs-decision freeze from cnos#367
- Composition with V (§4)
- δ-as-role boundary constraints (§5)

**Phase 4b — harness substrate (landed).** Dispatch invocation shells and observability contract, per-actor git identity with worktree-aware writes, parallel-α worktree pre-creation, polling and wake-up forms, branch-retry under push restrictions, and timeout recovery — previously authored as inline shell prose in the δ-coordinator surface — have landed in [`harness/SKILL.md`](../harness/SKILL.md) as Phase 4b of cnos#366 (cycle/398).

**Phase 4c — release-effector mechanics (landed).** The release-effector mechanics formerly living in `operator/SKILL.md` §3.4 (the single-command release script invocation, post-push CI polling, the recovery runbook, branch deletes, manual-tag prohibition) have landed in [`release-effector/SKILL.md`](../release-effector/SKILL.md) as Phase 4c of cnos#366 (cycle/399). The β-side authoring stays in `release/SKILL.md` (§2.4 CHANGELOG, §2.5 RELEASE.md, §2.5a cycle-dir move, pre-release validators); release-effector handles the δ-side mechanics only.

**Phase 5 — γ shrink (landed).** `gamma/SKILL.md` reduced to coordination + closure + triage doctrine; runtime supervision mechanics (polling shell, dispatch invocation shells, branch pre-flight bash) now cross-reference `harness/SKILL.md` and `release-effector/SKILL.md` rather than restating. Landed via cnos#400 (cycle/400).

All three substrate surfaces are now landed. δ-as-role's authority over the platform actions is named in §1.1 above; the harness substrate lives in `harness/SKILL.md`; release-effector mechanics live in `release-effector/SKILL.md`; operator-as-coordinator routing discipline (gate-action confirmation, request-vs-observation) lives in `operator/SKILL.md` §3.
